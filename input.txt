#lighthouse %lighthouse & this shouldn't be visible but is
 The lighthouse sits on the edge of a cliff, defiantly piercing the seascape behind it.
 You try the door, but it seems jammed.  ~breakIn   The door is wide open, the head of an axe embedded into its front.
 Empty                   ~breakIn   What used to be a handle is now splinters on the ground.

& this shouldn't be visible and isn't

*Return to the road. > a road
 You walk back down the road. & this should be visible and is

*Force it open. -axe @breakIn <1
 You swing the axe at the doorâ€” it doesn't budge. You try again, harder this time, and it cracks.
 The axe head snaps from the end of the handle, embedding itself in the door as it lurches wide open.

*Enter. ~breakIn > lighthouse 2
You hesitate before walking inside.
