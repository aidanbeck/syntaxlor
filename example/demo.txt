 Each knock sounds farther and farther away.
*Turn around. > rock cave
 You return, moving with even more caution.
*Descend. > rock cave 4 $rope

& SANDY BEACH

#sandy beach %sandy beach
 The wind flows over the beach and carries the smell of sea salt. A strip of sand runs between a tall cliff and crashing waves.
 Rock Cave is embedded in the cliff. On a large rock near the entrance, a conch shell sits propped up as if it were displayed there.
*Walk along the beach. > sandy beach 2
 As you walk along the sea, you notice something poking out of the waters in the distance.
 You squint, but you can't make it out from here.

 It's beautiful.

*Enter the cave. > rock cave 2

#sandy beach 2 %sandy beach
 The cliff veers away from the ocean and the beach widens. In the distance, you can see a lighthouse over a large hill. Overgrown with shrubs and driftwood, a trail zig`-zags to the top.
 On the beach, an old sailboat lays on its side. Piles of sand have accumulated at its base, all but burying it.
*Follow the trail. > a road
 Excited to reunite with civilization, you climb the hill.
*Investigate the boat. > ol' reliable
 You brush a thin layer of sand off the side of its stern.
*Head towards Rock Cave. > sandy beach

#ol' reliable %ol' reliable
 Written on the stern in faded paint is the ship's name: "ol' reliable". It remains mostly intact despite its situation.
 The cabin door is locked, and through the window you can see it's filled with sand that covers most of its contents. However, an old axe still seems salvageable.
*Salvage axe. $key +axe
 You unlock the door. With your bare hands, you dig it out of the sand.
*Return to the beach. > sandy beach 2


& UPPER AREA

#a road %a road
At the top of the hill, the trail connects to a dirt road. It doesn't look like anyone has been here in a long time. The road continues towards the lighthouse, passing a tent marked with a red cross.

& LIGHTHOUSE

#lighthouse %lighthouse
 The lighthouse sits on the edge of a cliff, defiantly piercing the seascape behind it.
 You try the door, but it seems jammed. ~breakIn The door is wide open, the head of an axe embedded into its front.
 Empty ~breakIn What used to be a handle is now splinters on the ground.
*Return to the road. > a road
*Force it open. -axe @breakIn

 The axe head snaps from the end of the handle, embedding itself in the door as it lurches wide open.

*Enter. > lighthouse 2 ~breakIn
 You hesitate before walking inside.
